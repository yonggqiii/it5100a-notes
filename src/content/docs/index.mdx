## About IT5100A
**Typed functional programming** is becoming more widely adopted in industry, as can be seen in the success of a number of advanced programming languages, such as **OCaml**, **Haskell** and **Scala 3**. These advanced languages offer a range of expressive features to allow robust, reusable and high-performing software codes to be safely and rapidly developed. This course will cover key programming techniques of typed functional programming that are becoming widely adopted, such as **strong typing**, **code composition** and **abstraction**, **effect handlers**, and safe techniques for **asynchronous and concurrent programming**.
