title: Software Transactional Memory

Concurrency and parallelism is, generally, _really hard_. This is because the ordering of concurrent and parallel evaluation is _nondeterministic_, and the traditional threaded model of concurrent programming with threads make working with concurrent operations and _composing_ them is very difficult and error-prone. `MVar`s and Haskell's runtime make this slightly safer (if you have done concurrency in other languages like C before, you might be able to see why), but are still vulnerable to the same issues that plague concurrent and parallel programs.

To give you a toy example, suppose we have two threads, one which acquires two `MVar`s `a` and `b` and adds the value of `a` to `b`, and another which swaps their values. One possible implementation might be the following, with a deadly vulnerability hidden in plain sight:

```haskell
swap :: MVar a -> MVar a -> Chan () -> IO ()
swap a b chan = do
    x <- takeMVar a
    y <- takeMVar b
    putMVar a y
    putMVar b x
    writeChan chan () -- signal done

addToMVar :: Num a => MVar a -> MVar a -> Chan () -> IO ()
addToMVar a b chan = do
    y <- takeMVar b
    x <- takeMVar a
    let z = x + y
    putMVar b z
    putMVar a x
    writeChan chan () -- signal done

main :: IO ()
main = do
    a <- newMVar 1 :: IO (MVar Int)
    b <- newMVar 2 :: IO (MVar Int)
    chan <- newChan :: IO (Chan ())
    forkIO $ addToMVar a b chan
    forkIO $ swap a b chan
    _ <- readChan chan
    _ <- readChan chan
    x <- takeMVar a
    y <- takeMVar b
    print x
    print y
    return ()
```

In this program, several things could happen:
- `swap` starts first, and is able to acquire the values from both `MVar`s `a` and `b`, thus executing completely and putting new values to `a` and `b` for `addToMVar` to use
- `addToMVar` starts first and is able to acquire the values from both `MVar`s `a` and `b`, thus executing completely and putting new values to `a` and `b` for `swap` to use
- `swap` starts first and acquires `a`, shortly thereafter `addToMVar` begins and acquires `b`. Now `swap` is waiting for `b`, and `addToMVar` is waiting for `a`.
- `addToMVar` starts first and acquires `b`, shortly thereafter `swap` begins and acquires `a`. Now `swap` is waiting for `b`, and `addToMVar` is waiting for `a`.

The last two scenarios result in something known as a _deadlock_ and causes all these threads to wait and to be unable to continue. In particular, this deadlock was caused by a _lock ordering inversion_, a very common mistake that is usually undetectable by the compiler, and only starts causing problems at runtime! Scenarios like these are known as _race conditions_, and yes, while there are tools to detect _race conditions_, detecting _all_ race conditions is _undecidable_, and thus is an impossible problem to solve. Are there tools to help us reduce of likelihood of running into race conditions? 

Haskell supports something known as _software transactional memory_ (STM) [(Harris et al.; 2005)](#stm), which is very similar to _transactions_ in databases with ACID guarantees. Notice that this deadlock situation could go away if `swap` and `addToMVar` acquired both locks in one atomic operation, so that neither thread can interleave an `MVar` acquisition! STM provides such facilities to allow us to define, compose and work with atomic transactions. All we need to do is to install the [`stm`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/stm) package!

## Key Ideas
Instead of working with the `IO` monad, STM constructs work within the `STM` monad. Under the hood, the `stm` implementation handles all the coordination, so as programmers, as long as we are working within the `STM` monad, we can regard these operations as atomic. In other words, an STM transaction appears to take place indivisibly. All transactional operations are within `STM`, and can only be escaped to `IO` using `atomically`:

```haskell
ghci> import Control.Concurrent.STM
ghci> :t atomically
atomically :: STM a -> IO a
```
An `atomically` block is treated as a single I/O operation, so the `STM` operations cannot interleave. In addition, the `atomically` block executes a transaction entirely, or not at all.

Now let us try using `STM` for communications between threads. We are going to create a transaction for atomically acquiring both `MVar`s. Of course, instead of `MVar`, which operates in the `IO` monad, the `Control.Concurrent.STM` module exposes a `TMVar`, sort of like a _transactional_ `MVar` that lives in the `STM` monad. Let us write this transaction:

```haskell
takeBothTMVars :: TMVar a -> TMVar b -> STM (a, b)
takeBothTMVars a b = do
  x <- takeTMVar a
  y <- takeTMVar b
  return (x, y)
```
As you can see, this looks just like an equivalent version written for `MVar`s:

```haskell
takeBothMVars :: MVar a -> MVar b -> IO (a, b)
takeBothMVars a b = do
  x <- takeMVar a
  y <- takeMVar b
  return (x, y)
```

Now let us rewrite our original deadlocked program using `TMVar`s and `STM`, focusing temporarily on the `swap` function. Recall that we want to take both `TMVar`s as a single atomic operation, hence we defined an `STM` operation `takeBothTMVars` that does so. To actually perform this operation as a single I/O action, we have to use `atomically` which performs the transaction, atomically:

```haskell
swap :: TMVar a -> TMVar a -> Chan () -> IO ()
swap a b chan = do
    (x, y) <- atomically $ takeBothTMVars a b
    -- ...
```
This way, the transaction is done in one fell swoop, and if either `TMVar`s are empty, the thread running `swap` will block until both become available. We can do the same for `addToMVar`, but this time, we are going to introduce lock-order inversion again by swapping the arguments to `takeBothTMVars`:

```haskell
addToMVar :: Num a => TMVar a -> TMVar a -> Chan () -> IO ()
addToMVar a b chan = do
    (y, x) <- atomically $ takeBothTMVars b a
```
Although we swapped the arguments to `takeBothTMVars`, thereby introducing lock-order inversion, operationally, there is no difference, since `takeBothTMVars` is regarded as a single atomic operation anyway. We then continue defining the rest of the program which should be similar to before. Importantly, note that to create a new `TMVar` within `IO` for coordination, we use the `newTMVarIO` function; 

```haskell
import Control.Concurrent
import Control.Concurrent.Chan
import Control.Concurrent.STM

takeBothTMVars :: TMVar a -> TMVar b -> STM (a, b)
takeBothTMVars a b = do
  x <- takeTMVar a
  y <- takeTMVar b
  return (x, y)

putBothTMVars :: TMVar a -> a -> TMVar b -> b -> STM ()
putBothTMVars a x b y = do
  putTMVar a x
  putTMVar b y

swap :: TMVar a -> TMVar a -> Chan () -> IO ()
swap a b chan = do
    (x, y) <- atomically $ takeBothTMVars a b 
    atomically $ putBothTMVars a y b x
    writeChan chan ()

addToMVar :: Num a => TMVar a -> TMVar a -> Chan () -> IO ()
addToMVar a b chan = do
    (y, x) <- atomically $ takeBothTMVars b a
    let z = x + y
    atomically $ putBothTMVars a x b z
    writeChan chan ()

main :: IO ()
main = do
    a <- newTMVarIO 1 :: IO (TMVar Int)
    b <- newTMVarIO 2 :: IO (TMVar Int)
    chan <- newChan :: IO (Chan ())
    forkIO $ addToMVar a b chan
    forkIO $ swap a b chan
    _ <- readChan chan
    _ <- readChan chan
    x <- atomically $ takeTMVar a
    y <- atomically $ takeTMVar b
    print x
    print y
```

We don't have to only use STM for coordination between threads (although that is certainly a great use case). As long as we want atomic memory transactions, it is highly likely that STM is applicable. 

For example, suppose we have some in-memory shared state, such as a counter, and users (perhaps across the network) can modify this counter. Modifying the counter requires two things: (1) reading the existing counter, (2) modifying the read value, (3) updating the counter with the modified value. To prevent data races, we want all these operations to be done in one fell swoop (i.e. as a single transaction).

```haskell
incVar :: TVar Int -> STM Int
incVar v = do
  x <- readTVar v
  let y = x + 1
  writeTVar v y
  return y
```

Now we're not afraid to compose `incVar` with other STM operations, even if they are done concurrently!

```haskell
import Control.Concurrent
import Control.Concurrent.STM

-- Increments a 'TVar'
incVar :: TVar Int -> STM Int
incVar v = do
  x <- readTVar v
  let y = x + 1
  writeTVar v y
  return y

-- IO Action that increments a TVar five times
aIncVar :: TVar Int -> IO ()
aIncVar v = aux 5 where
  aux :: Int -> IO ()
  aux 0 = return ()
  aux n = do
    r <- atomically $ incVar v
    print r
    aux (n - 1)

main :: IO ()
main = do
    n <- getNumCapabilities
    putStrLn $ "Number of cores: " ++ show n
    -- Initialize the counter
    counter <- newTVarIO 0 :: IO (TVar Int)
    -- For example, run four threads that increment the counter 5 times
    forkIO $ aIncVar counter
    forkIO $ aIncVar counter
    forkIO $ aIncVar counter
    forkIO $ aIncVar counter
    -- Sleep so we can wait for the other threads to complete
    threadDelay 1000000
```

When executing this program, you should notice that the counter is being incremented correctly, with a final value of `20`. 

The `stm` library provides many other useful facilities for writing transactional programs. Refer to the library documentation or the original paper for more details.

## Concurrent and Parallel Programming in Haskell

In summary, concurrent and parallel programming in Haskell is, generally, not too dissimilar to that in other general-purpose languages. However, because Haskell is a purely functional and non-strict evaluation language, there are several neat things at our disposable. For one, it is relatively straightforward to fork an I/O action to be performed concurrently, and to use synchronizing variables like `MVar` for communication between threads. Importantly, the Haskell runtime ensures that `MVar`s are only taken from or put by one thread, so synchronization is inherent in its implementation. However, using `MVar`s alone can get cumbersome especially when dealing with multiple concurrent operations that do not compose well; hence, the introduction of STM for atomic transactions to reduce the likelihood of accidentally introducing race conditions and deadlocks. In addition, because Haskell has non-strict evaluation, parallelizing it is fairly straightforward, by simply annotating the functions with `par` and `pseq` function applications to describe what operation should be done in parallel with what else. 

Most importantly, ideas like I/O actions, STM transactions and even parallel evaluation strategies are all exposed as monads, and programs that are written with these can make use of all the guarantees and conveniences that monads have to offer. As before, monads are some of the most powerful concepts in programming, and it helps dramatically to have programming languages that make working with them easy.

Lastly, concurrency and parallelism are huge topics in Computer Science in and of itself. Since many of what is described in this course are not as generally applicable to other general-purpose languages, many of the details are omitted. More information is readily available online and in the original papers describing the various systems like Concurrent and Parallel Haskell, and STM. This may be useful if you are interested in a pursuing a career involving Haskell development, or wish to learn, more deeply, about some of the ideas we have presented.
