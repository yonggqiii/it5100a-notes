# IT5100A&mdash;Industry Readiness: Typed Functional Programming

_by Foo Yong Qi_

This is a set of lecture notes for students enrolled in IT5100A&mdash;Industry Readiness: Typed Functional Programming in NUS SoC.

## About IT5100A
Typed functional programming are becoming more widely adopted in industry, as can be seen in the success of a number of advanced programming languages, such as OCaml, Haskell and Scala 3. These advanced languages offer a range of expressive features to allow robust, reusable and high-performing software codes to be safely and rapidly developed. This course will cover key programming techniques of typed functional programming that are becoming widely adopted, such as strong typing, code composition and abstraction, effect handlers, and safe techniques for asynchronous and concurrent programming.

## About These Notes
I hope that these notes can be used as good supplementary material for those looking to learn Functional Programming in a bit more detail :)

## Release History
### 2024 Sep 24
The first draft of these notes have been released with the first three chapters and their solutions to exercises completed.
