Monads are a frequently recurring construct in functional programming, declarative programming and computer science, especially in programming language and logical semantics. In this chapter, we dive deeper into programming with monads and some additional supported operations beyond `return` and `>>=` and how to use them. Additionally, we show some more frequently used monads that go beyond the railway pattern, and show how monads _themselves_ can be composed using _monad transformers_.
